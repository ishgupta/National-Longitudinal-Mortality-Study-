# Suicidial Catalysts

A Survival analysis study intended to study the Suicides committed by US population, and try finding out the commonality, if any, to discover any issues to help people out giving up on their lives.

The data being referred was made available by the National Longitudinal mortality Survey conducted for over 11 years of follow up. The study was sponsored by National Cancer Institute, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the National Institute on Aging, the National Center for Health Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau for the purpose of studying the effects of differentials in demographic and socio-economic characteristics on mortality.

US is a huge country housing people from all over the World, and there can be multiple reasons for an Individual to give up on his/her Life:
 1. Is their Origin an issue driving them towards Suicide?	
 2. Could Employment, workplace, Income, Education be a reason?
 3. Are Females feeling outcasted at Workplace/ Home ?
 4. Are people living in Urban areas more affected?
 5. Are Veterans driven by PTSD to commit a Suicide?
 6. Did Whites commit most of the Suicides?

And many more questions... can be observed when we think about people committing an act to give up on their Lives.

A Survival Analysis study usually have both sort of people, who could survive the Survey, and the ones who could not.
But, for Suicides- Trends do not have any Censor scenarios.

This study, hence, finds out the common factors among people who chose to gave up on their Lives, and discovers some suggestive measures, which, if taken, can be helpful in preventing the loss of Lives.
